This work is data analysis portofolio project for Codecademy Business Intelligence Data Analyst path. The analysts need to interpret data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks. Analysts perform data analysis on conservation statuses of these species and investigate if there are any patterns or themes. 

The folder includes the following files:
- `biodiversity.ipnyb`: Jupyter Notebook with analysis description, code, and figures
- `species_info.csv`, `observations.csv`: CSV files with basic data about the species and observation data from National Parks, which used in `biodiversity.ipnyb`

Project scoping creates structure while requiring the analysts before begin the entire project and make adjustments along the way. The project is conducted as follows:
- Understand the problem
- Find the project goals
- Gather and load the data
- Explore and explain data
- Conclusions about the process and findings
